Programming and Scripting project - Analysis of the Iris dataset using Python


## Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project is the [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris), first introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936.

It contains 150 observations across three species of iris flowers:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

Each observation includes four numerical features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

This dataset is widely used for data visualization and machine learning tutorials due to its simplicity and balanced class distribution.
