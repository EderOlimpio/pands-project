## Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, first introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936.

It contains 150 observations across three species of iris flowers:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

Each observation includes four numerical features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

This dataset is widely used for data visualization and machine learning tutorials due to its simplicity and balanced class distribution.

## Project Overview

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Iris dataset using Python. It includes:

- Summary statistics
- Histograms of each numeric variable
- A scatterplot matrix (pairplot)
- A correlation heatmap

## Files

- `iris.csv` — Dataset file
- `analysis.py` — Main script performing the analysis
- `summary.txt` — Text summary of statistics
- `images/` — Contains:
  - Histograms (`histogram_*.png`)
  - Pairplot (`pairplot_all.png`)
  - Correlation heatmap (`heatmap_correlation.png`)
